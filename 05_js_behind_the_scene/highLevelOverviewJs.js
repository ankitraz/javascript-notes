// what is javascript?
// high level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language

// high level - developer does not have to worry about memory allocation, garbage collection, etc. we don't have to manage resources
// garbage collection - automatically remove unused memory
// interpreted or just-in-time compiled - code is executed line by line, but it is compiled at runtime
// multi-paradigm - procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming. paradigm is a style of code
//prototype-based object-oriented - prototype is a parent object that we can inherit methods and properties from (inheritance)
// first-class functions - functions are simply treated as variables. we can pass them into other functions, and return them from functions
// dynamic - dynamically typed language. data types are determined at runtime. variables can hold different types of values
// single-threaded - one command is executed at a time. synchronous execution
// non-blocking event loop - asynchronous behavior. asynchronous tasks are handled by the event loop, so that they don't block the execution of the program
